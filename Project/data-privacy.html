      <div class="legal-content">
        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect information you provide directly to us when you create an
          account. This includes your email address, full name, designation, and
          any profile photo you choose to upload. We do not collect any personal
          information beyond what is necessary for account functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is used solely for the purpose of personalizing your
          experience on our website (e.g., greeting you by name) and managing
          your account. Your profile information, including your avatar and
          name, is publicly visible to other users. Your email address is kept
          private.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          All user data is securely stored and managed by our backend provider,
          Supabase. We rely on their industry-standard security measures to
          protect your information.
        </p>

        <h2>Deleting Your Account</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all
          associated data at any time. To do so, please follow the instructions
          on your account settings page to send a deletion request to our
          support email.
